@Paid Games that don't require a Pirated Version to play! 

-[powerslave](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VFvOYKyjyFwH5sqSL5mz_jl3SdIUcAOY/view) -PowerSlaveEX was a free and open-source source port/remaster of the PowerSlave PlayStation version for PC. Unfortunately, it was taken down years ago. I currently have the Windows version available, including the essential mouse movement fix patch—without this patch, the game is completely unplayable.

In this game, you play as a marine battling evil alien forces in Karnak, Egypt. These invaders wiped out the local population and turned them into Egyptian-themed monsters like Anubis-headed warriors, mummies, and leopard beasts.


- [openRA](https://www.openra.net) -A free, open-source, and community-made remaster of Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn, Red Alert 1, and DUNE 2000. It features improved graphics, bug fixes, and a refreshed feel while still staying true to the original games.

It’s pretty solid overall and does a great job of capturing the classic vibe.

- [plutonium](https://plutonium.pw) - Free, Community made remaster of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, Modern Warfare 3, and World at War. Provides a little bit of a fresh new experience, fixes problems with the original games, and is very good. Provides server lists, dedicated servers, online gameplay, and customizabale options for your gameplay.


# Direct Download Sites:

Best site overall: CS.RIN.RU - Steam Underground Community - Best place for any game, this should be the first place you check. Does not allow Scene releases.

Other noteworthy mentions:

- [crackhub](https://crackhub.site/) - DDL for scene games and FitGirl repacks.
